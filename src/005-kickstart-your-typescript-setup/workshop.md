## Section 1

Discuss each of the questions below in your groups.

### How is TypeScript different to JavaScript?
Main difference is that JS can run in browser and Node but it doesn't have IDE server support, types and tooling. TS have it all but needs to be compiled with TS CLI

### Can you turn TypeScript into JavaScript?
Yep

### What kind of mistakes does TypeScript help prevent?
Type errors, a wrong function call with wrong arguments, mismatch in types, Using non-existent object properties

### Does TypeScript make your code run faster?
It doesn't really affect it since after it's built it's a pure JS

### What is a 'type'?
A type describes the shape and kind of data (number, string, object, function, etc.). It tells the compiler what values are allowed and enables TypeScript to validate correctness before runtime.
